        <p>
          It is a soft rice roll filled with ground pork and wood ear mushrooms.
          You eat it with some fresh veggies and a little bit of nuoc cham. It’s
          just magic in your mouth. Yummm. Since I’m not visiting her this year,
          I decided to try my hand at making banh cuon for myself.

      <div class="recipe-ingredients">
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup rice flour</li>
          <li>1 cup tapioca flour</li>
          <li>4 cups room temperature water</li>
          <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
          <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Making the batter: Combine rice flour, tapioca flour, room
            temperature water, vegetable oil, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well
            and let it rest for 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the batter is resting, soak the wood ear mushrooms in a bowl
            of water for 20 minutes. Once done soaking, wring out as much water
            as possible. Coarsely chop them into small pieces and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine the pork, fish sauce, sugar, and pepper. Marinate for 10
            minutes and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Making the filling: In a large pan, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable
            oil over medium high heat. Add in the onions and cook for 30
            seconds. Add in the ground pork and wood ear mushrooms and cook
            until well done (about 2-3 minutes). Set filling aside.
