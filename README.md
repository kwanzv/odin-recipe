# odin-recipe

This was one of the early front end projects which required you to make a landing page to a recipe website with 3 anchor links to separate pages for specific recipes.

I initially made a very barebones page with a lack of visuals and call to action components but was inspired by a popular recipe website that I stumbled upon.

The tools are still very basic, I just used basic HTML with SASS and a grid layout to make the site responsive in desktop and mobile modes.

I found some issues implementing my grid with SASS , when the media queries were not at the top, the changes did not take affect successfully.
